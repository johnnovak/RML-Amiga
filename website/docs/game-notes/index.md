# Game notes

This section contains important game tips and guidance that is a bit hard to
figure out on your own. It is highly recommended to always check this page
before trying out a new game.

The easiest way to find the notes for a game is to click on the search box in
the upper-right corner of this page, start typing in the game's name or a part
of it, then click on the game you're looking for in the search results.

Alternatively, you can press the ++s++ key to bring up the search dialog,
start typing, navigate the search result with the cursor keys, and press
