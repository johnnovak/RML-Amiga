# Game notes

This section contains important game tips and guidance that is a bit hard to
figure out on your own. It is highly recommended to always check this page
before trying out a new game.

If you're reading this documentation on the [RML Amiga
website](https://rml-amiga.johnnovak.net/), the easiest way to find the notes
for a game is to click on the search box in the upper-right corner of this
page, start typing in the game's name or a part of it, then click on the game
you're looking for in the search results.

Alternatively, you can press the ++s++ key to bring up the search dialog,
start typing, navigate the search result with the cursor keys, and press
++enter++ to select a game.

The search is not available in the local copy of the documentation included in
the RML Amiga installation.
