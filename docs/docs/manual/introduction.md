# Introduction

Welcome to this curated collection of (mostly) cerebral Amiga
games! Adventures, RPGs, simulators, strategy, board and puzzle games are the
stars of the show, but a small number of arcade classics are also
included.


What differentiates this from all other Amiga game collections? Quite a few
things:


Authentic experience
: Every single game has been painstakingly set up for an optimal and
  authentic experience. The primary goal is to run unaltered originals on the
  systems they were developed for, which is a stock or expanded Amiga 500 for
  most titles.

Play floppy games like a boss
: Every floppy game comes pre-configured to use multiple disk drives if the game
  supports it. This means reduced or zero disk swapping in the best case.
  Blank save disks are also provided per game (creating these is often tedious
  and error-prone).

No more bad cracks
: For games designed to run from floppies, the original floppy
  images are preferred with the disk-based protection intact. Cracks,
  WHDLoad, and other hacks are avoided and are only used as a last resort.
  No more worrying about bad cracks in those 40+ hour RPGs!

Native hard drive installations
: Hard drive installations are preferred for games that natively support it.
  That's most big American releases, and many European RPG, adventure, and
  strategy titles.

Authentic CRT monitor emulation
: Pixel art drawn and intended to be viewed on Commodore CRT monitors looks
  broken on modern flat screen with the pixels displayed as razor sharp little
  rectangles. A CRT shader setup is included that authentically recreates the
  look of Commodore monitors people typically used their Amigas with.

PAL/NTSC & aspect ratio correctness
: All games are correctly set up for PAL or NTSC, prioritising developer
  intent. No more playing American releases with squashed graphics and 20%
  slower music or gameplay! Moreover, PAL games that assume "NTSC stretch" are
  correctly set up, too.

All necessary information included
: Manuals, code wheels, reference cards, box art, audio recordings, and
  various other extras are all included.


## Why play Amiga games?

Because they're fun! Duh.

More seriously, what's the point when most of these games have been ported to
DOS, so you might as well just play the DOS version in [DOSBox
Staging](https://dosbox-staging.github.io/)?

## Hardware requirements

The collection has been developed and tested on Windows 10 64-bit. It will
most likely work fine on more recent Windows versions, and probably on Windows
7 64-bit too.

Only 64-bit Windows versions are supported.

The CRT shader setup is optimised for 1080p monitors (1920&times;1080
resolution), but should work on any display. A variable refresh rate (VRR),
adaptive-sync display (e.g., Nvidia G-Sync or AMD FreeSync capable) is not
mandatory but highly recommended for an optimal experience.

A dedicated GPU released after 2015 is recommended. Integrated graphics
adapters might work too, but some tweaking of the defaults might be required.
