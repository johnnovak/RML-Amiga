# Introduction

Welcome **RML Amiga** (**R**incewind's **M**agic **L**uggage Full of Amiga
Goodies), a prestigious curated collection of (mostly) cerebral Amiga
games! Adventures, RPGs, simulators, strategy, board and puzzle games are the
stars of the show, but a small number of arcade classics are also included.

The aim of this collection is to recreate the Original Authentic Experienceâ„¢ of sitting
in front of a real Amiga connected to a Commodore CRT monitor, playing the
original uncracked and unaltered versions of these games.

Does this mean you'll need to play all games from floppies and put up with
long loading times? No!  The good news is the majority of big multi-disk games
are hard drive installable, so about 70% of the games in the collection run
from an emulated hard drive. 15% of the titles are single-disk floppy games
and about 8% are multi-disk games that support multiple disk drives, which
reduces or in some cases completely eliminating disk swapping. That leaves
only around 7% of multi-disk games where you need to do manual disk swapping.

A few games benefit from faster CPU speeds; these have been configured with an
emulated turbo card.


## Features in detail

Authentic experience
: Every single game has been painstakingly set up for an optimal and
  authentic experience. The primary goal is to run unaltered originals on the
  systems they were developed for, which is a stock or expanded Amiga 500 for
  most titles.

Play floppy games like a boss
: Every floppy game comes pre-configured to use multiple disk drives if the game
  supports it. This means reduced or zero disk swapping in the best case.
  Blank save disks are also provided for each game as creating these is often
  tedious and error-prone.

No more bad cracks
: For games designed to run from floppies, the original floppy
  images are preferred with the disk-based protection intact. Cracks,
  hacks, WHDLoad, and other fan-made content is generally avoided and is only
  used as a last resort. No more worrying about bad cracks in those 40+ hour
  RPGs!

Native hard drive installations
: Hard drive installations are preferred for games that natively support it.
  That's most big American releases, and many European RPG, adventure, and
  strategy titles. It turns out many games that don't have official HD
  installers can also be made to run from the hard drive with a little
  coercion.

Authentic CRT monitor emulation
: Pixel art drawn and intended to be viewed on 15 kHz, Commodore CRT monitors looks
  outright broken on modern flat screen with the pixels displayed as razor
  sharp little rectangles. A CRT shader setup is included that authentically
  recreates the look of Commodore monitors people typically used their Amigas
  with.

PAL/NTSC & aspect ratio correctness
: All games are correctly set up for PAL or NTSC aspect ratios, prioritising
  developer intent. No more playing American releases with squashed graphics
  and 20% slower music or gameplay! Moreover, PAL games that assume "NTSC
  stretch" are correctly set up, too (typically Atari ST ports and European
  multi-platform releases).

All necessary information included
: Manuals, code wheels, reference cards, box art, audio recordings, and
  various other extras are all included. Quite a few games are next to
  impossible to play without these materials.


## Hardware requirements

The collection has been developed and tested on Windows 10 64-bit. It will
most likely work fine on more recent Windows versions, and probably on Windows
7 64-bit too. Only 64-bit Windows versions are supported.

The CRT shader setup is optimised for 1080p monitors (1920&times;1080
resolution), but should work on any display. A variable refresh rate (VRR),
adaptive-sync display (e.g., Nvidia G-Sync or AMD FreeSync capable) is not
mandatory but highly recommended for an optimal experience.

A CPU and a dedicated GPU released after 2015 is recommended. Integrated
graphics adapters will probably work too, but some tweaking of the shaders
might be required.


## Why play Amiga games?

Because they're fun! Duh.

More seriously, what's the point when most of these games have been ported to
DOS, so you might as well just play the DOS version in [DOSBox
Staging](https://dosbox-staging.github.io/)?
