# Introduction

Welcome **RML Amiga** (**R**incewind's **M**agic **L**uggage Full of Amiga
Goodies), a prestigious curated collection of (mostly) cerebral Amiga
games! Adventures, RPGs, simulators, strategy, board and puzzle games are the
stars of the show, but a small number of arcade classics are also included.

The aim of this collection is to recreate the Original Authentic Experienceâ„¢
of sitting in front of a real Amiga connected to a Commodore CRT monitor,
playing the uncracked and unaltered originals.

Does this mean you'll need to use floppies and put up with disk swapping and
long loading times? No! Contrary to popular belief, the majority of big
multi-disk games are hard drive installable. To break it down:

- About 70% of the games in the collection run from an emulated hard drive.
- 15% of the titles are single-disk floppy games; they require no disk swapping.
- 8% of the multi-disk games support multiple floppy drives; this reduces or
  completely eliminates disk swapping.
- That leaves 7% of multi-disk games that only support a single floppy
  drive and require manual disk swapping.


## Features in detail

Authentic experience
: Every single game has been painstakingly set up for an optimal and
  authentic experience. The primary goal is to run unaltered originals on the
  systems they were developed for, which is a stock or expanded Amiga 500 for
  most titles. A very small number of titles run on an emulated Amiga 1200,
  Amiga CD32, or Commodore CDTV.

Optimal configurations
: Some games benefit from faster CPUs or extra memory (e.g., might show more
  varied graphics, animations, or have more music and sound effects). Figuring
  this out for each game is tricky, requires some Amiga-knowledge, manual or
  forum diving, and can be frankly tedious. The good news is, you don't have
  to worry about any of that; every game has been configured to give you the
  most the game has to offer.

Native hard drive installations
: Hard drive installations are preferred for games that natively support it.
  That's most big American releases, and many European RPG, adventure, and
  strategy titles. Quite a few games that don't have official HD installers
  and feature no disk-based protection can run from hard drives; you just
  need to copy the files over and issue a few AmigaDOS commands to make
  the game "think" it runs from the original floppies.

No more bad cracks
: An overarching theme of the collection is "no hacks allowed!" For games
  designed to run from floppies, the original floppy images are preferred with
  the disk-based protection intact. Cracks, hacks, WHDLoad, and other fan-made
  content is generally avoided and is only used as a last resort. If a cracked
  version is used out of necessity, every effort is taken to confirm the game
  is completable. No more worrying about bad cracks in those 40+ hour RPGs!

Play floppy games like a boss
: Every floppy game comes pre-configured to use multiple floppy drives if the
  game supports it. This means reduced or zero disk swapping in the best case.
  Blank save disks are also provided for each game as creating them is often
  tedious and error-prone.

Authentic CRT monitor emulation
: Pixel art drawn and intended to be viewed on 15 kHz, Commodore CRT monitors looks
  outright broken on modern flat screen with the pixels displayed as razor
  sharp little rectangles. A CRT shader setup is included that authentically
  recreates the look of Commodore monitors people typically used their Amigas
  with.

PAL/NTSC & aspect ratio correctness
: All games are correctly set up for PAL or NTSC aspect ratios, prioritising
  developer intent. No more playing American releases with squashed graphics
  and 20% slower music or gameplay! Moreover, PAL games that assume "NTSC
  stretch" are correctly set up, too (typically Atari ST ports and European
  multi-platform releases).

Quality-of-life save states
: Some games force you to complete a manual-based protection check at startup,
  or take a really long time to load from floppies, or have an unskippable
  intro sequence. For these games, the collection provides save states taken
  right after the protection check or the intro as a quality-of-life
  enhancement. One less excuse for using questionable cracks and hacks!

All necessary information included
: Manuals, hint books, reference cards, interactive code wheels, maps,
  posters, box art, audio recordings, and various other extras to enjoy these
  games to the fullest are all included. Quite a few games are next to
  impossible to play without these materials. Significant effort has been
  taken to track down the best-looking scanned copies for each individual
  game.


## Hardware requirements

The collection has been developed and tested on Windows 10 64-bit. It will
most likely work fine on more recent Windows versions, and probably on Windows
7 64-bit too. Only 64-bit Windows versions are supported.

The CRT shader setup is optimised for 1080p monitors (1920&times;1080
resolution), but should work on any display. A variable refresh rate (VRR),
adaptive-sync display (e.g., Nvidia G-Sync or AMD FreeSync capable) is not
mandatory but highly recommended for an optimal experience.

A CPU and a dedicated GPU released after 2015 is recommended. Integrated
graphics adapters will probably work too, but some tweaking of the shaders
might be required.
