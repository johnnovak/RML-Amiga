# Hard drive installed games

Games that run from an emulated hard drive are the easiest to deal with. First
of all, they load much faster than floppy games and you don't need swap disks.
Secondly, most of these games can save your progress to the hard drive, so you
don't need to deal with save disks either.


## Saving your progress

Most hard drive installed games store the save games on the hard drive; using
the save and restore game functionality in these games should be
straightforward. A minority of games insist on using a save disk even when
installed to the hard drive---these special games are mentioned on the [Game
notes](game-notes.md) page. (Future Wars ?)
