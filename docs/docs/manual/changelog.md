## v1.0

Welcome to the first version of RML-Amiga! This initial release features a
whopping 214 stone-cold classics for the intelligent gamer, including:

- All **Delphine**, **Horrorsoft/Adventure Soft**, **ICOM**, **Magnetic
  Scrolls**, **Lucasfilm/LucasArts**, **Revolution** adventures that were
  released on the Amiga.

- All **Interplay** Amiga releases (their early
  adventures, **The Bard's Tale** series, **Dragon Wars**, **Neuromancer**, etc.)

- Iconic strategy titles and action/strategy hybrids such as **SimCity**,
  **Lemmings**, **Pirates!**, **Populous**, **Powermonger**, **Cannon
  Fodder**, **Midwinter**, **The Settlers**, **The Perfect General**, and
  several others.

- 100% working uncracked originals of **Dungeon Master** (v2.2 and v3.60),
  **Chaos Strikes Back**, and **Fate: Gates of Dawn** which are notorious
  for their elaborate copy-protections.

- The entire Amiga **SSI Gold Box** catalog. 

- The original OCS/ECS versions of **Eye of the Beholder I & II** and their
  fan-made AGA remakes. These are the definitive versions as they
  combine the 256-colour VGA graphics of the PC originals with the superior
  sound of the Amiga ports.

- Many other RPGs that are either Amiga-exclusives (**Perihelion**,
  **Amberstar**, **Black  Crypt**) or are best on the Amiga (**Legend
  of Faerghail**, **Ambermoon**, **Captive**, **Knightmare**, **Moonstone: A
  Hard Day's Knight**, **Starflight**, **Ishar series**, etc.)

- All AGI and SCI0 **Sierra** adventures (everything except for the
  questionable VGA ports, with optional Roland MT-32 sound in the few
  games that support it).

- All 34 **Incofom** text adventures with all supplementary materials
  (that's every Infocom text adventure except for **Border Zone** that never
  had an Amiga release).

- A good selection of **Cinemaware** classic (**Defender of the Crown**,
  **Lords of the Rising Sun**, and **It Came from the Desert I & II**).

- Arguably the best-looking version of **Elite** classic.

- All Freescape games by **Incentive** (**Driller**, **Dark Side**, **Total
  Eclipse**, **Castle Master I & II**).

- A handful of action game favourites (**Pinball Dreams**, **Agony**,
  **Shadow of the Beast**, **Speedball 2: Brutal Deluxe**, **IK+**, etc.)

And a lot more---check out the full games list! Of course, all games come with
manuals, code wheels, hint books, posters, box cover scans, and all sorts of
other supplementary materials to enjoy the games to the fullest.

About 70% of the titles run from an emulated hard drive. The remaining 30%
are floppy games that require either no or only very minimal disk swapping.
