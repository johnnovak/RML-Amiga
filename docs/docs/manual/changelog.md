# Changelog

## v1.0

Welcome to the first version of RML-Amiga! This initial release features a bit
over 200 games including:

- All **Delphine**, **Horrorsoft/Adventure Soft**, **ICOM**, **Magnetic
  Scrolls**, **Lucasfilm/LucasArts**, **Revolution** adventures that were
  released on the Amiga.

- The 34 **Incofom** text adventures with all supplementary materials
  (everything except for **Border Zone** that never had an Amiga release).

- Iconic strategy titles and action/strategy hybrids such as **SimCity**,
  **Lemmings**, **Pirates!**, **Populous**, **Powermonger**, **Cannon
  Fodder**, **Midwinter**, **The Settlers**, **The Perfect General**, and
  several others.

- 100% working uncracked originals of **Dungeon Master** (v2.2 and v3.60),
  **Chaos Strikes Back**, and **Fate: Gates of Dawn** that are notorious
  for their elaborate copy-protections.

- The entire Amiga **SSI Gold Box** catalog. 

- The original OCS/ECS versions of **Eye of the Beholder I & II** and their
  fan-made AGA remakes. These are the definitive versions as they
  combine the 256-colour VGA graphics of the PC originals with the superior
  sound of the Amiga ports, plus add an auto-map feature.

- Many other RPGs that are either Amiga-exclusives (**Perihelion**,
  **Amberstar**, **Black  Crypt**) or are best on the Amiga (**Legend
  of Faerghail**, **Ambermoon**, **Captive**, **Knightmare**, **Moonstone: A
  Hard Day's Knight**, **Bard's Tale, The: Tales of the
  Unknown**, **Starflight**, **Ishar series**, etc.)

- All AGI and SCI0 **Sierra** adventures (everything except for the
  questionable VGA ports, with optional Roland MT-32 sound in the few
  games that support it).

- A good selection of **Cinemaware** classic (**Defender of the Crown**,
  **Lords of the Rising Sun** and **It Came from the Desert I & II**).

- All Freescape games by **Incentive** (**Dark Side**, **Driller**, **Total
    Eclipse**, **Castle Master I & II**).

- A handful of all-time arcade favourites (**Pinball Dreams**, **Agony**, **Shadow of the
  Beast**, **Speedball 2: Brutal Deluxe**, **IK+**, etc.)

And a lot more---check out the full games list! Of course, all games come with
manuals, code wheels, hint books, posters, box cover scans, and all sorts of
other supplementary materials you will need to enjoy the games to the fullest.

About 70% of the titles run from an emulated hard drive. The remaining 30%
are floppy games that require either no or only very minimal disk swapping.
