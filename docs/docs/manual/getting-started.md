# Getting started

!!! warning "HALT! No one shall pass before reading this first!"

    If you've never used an Amiga before, you will _not_ get very far without
    reading this getting started section. You will probably not even make it
    past the intro of your first game...

    So please read these tips very carefully!

    Seasoned Amiga veterans who know the Amiga inside out should also read
    this because half of the information is emulation-related.


Starting a game

: Start the bundled portable Amiga emulator by running `winuae.exe` (creating
  an icon for it on your desktop is a good idea). This will bring up the
  configuration browser. If the **Games** folder is not expanded, double-click
  on it to open it. You can start typing into the search box to narrow down
  the list of game configs. Double-click on a config and the game will start
  (note that some floppy games might take a bit of time to load).

      Alternatively, select a game from the list by single clicking on it,
      click on the **Load** button below the configuration browser, then click
      **Start** to launch the game. You _must_ press **Load** before pressing
      **Start**, otherwise WinUAE will use the _last_ loaded config, or the
      default config if you haven't loaded anything yet!

      If you want to play a different game, it's best to quit WinUAE with
      ++alt+f4++ then start it again.

Skipping code checks
: Some games have additional special configs to skip the intro or the
  manual-based copy protection check at the start (e.g., `Altered Destiny
  [skip code check]`). It's advised to start the normal config for the first
  time to experience the intro and the original game at least once.


Use warp mode
: You can speed up floppy loading times considerably by entering "warp mode".
  This speeds up the emulation to the maximum your computer can handle. You can
  toggle warp mode with ++end+pause++ (there is no sound in warp mode and the
  emulated CPU speed indicator in the lower right corner will show a value
  greater than 100).

Read the manuals

: It's important to understand that control schemes and user interfaces were a
  lot less standardised in the 1980s and early 90s. You won't get very far in
  most games without reading the manuals, the reference cards, and other
  supplementary materials first. Look for these in the **Manual** and
  **Extras** sub-folders within the individual game folders.

Joystick-based games

: Most games in the collection are controlled with the mouse and the keyboard,
  but a few need a joystick. These games are configured for an emulated
  joystick: use the regular cursor keys (not the numeric keypad) for movement, and the
  ++ralt++, ++rshift++, or ++rctrl++ key for the fire button. If you want to
  use a real joystick or gamepad, press the fire button on the controller
  after starting the game and WinUAE will auto-detect it.

Floppy games
: Hard drive installed games are the easiest to deal with, floppy games need a
  bit of practice. Read the [Floppy games](#floppy-games) section for guidance.
  You can easily recognise a floppy game by the emulated floppy drive sounds.

Saving your progress
: When it comes to saving your game progress, it's a bit of a Wild West
  situation. Every game is slightly different, and floppy games that require
  dedicated save disks are the trickiest. But fear not, help is provided on
  the [Game notes](game-notes.md) page for these titles. Make sure to read the
  detailed [Saving your progress](#saving-your-progress) section as well for
  general tips.

Read the game notes
: Always check the [Game notes](game-notes.md) page for special instructions
  when trying a game for the first time. Some of the advice there is very hard
  to figure out on your own, or the information is deeply buried in the
  manual.

Customising your setup
: If you're a power user, you should consider configuring the games for proper
  vertical syncing (vsync) for the best results. This is an advanced topic
  detailed in the [Graphics customisation](customising-your-setup.md#graphics-customisation)
  section.
