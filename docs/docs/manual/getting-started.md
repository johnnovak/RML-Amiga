# Getting started

The basic usage is very simple: follow the [Installation
instructions](#installation), read the tips below, then try a few games!


!!! warning "HALT! No one shall pass before reading this first!"

    If you've never used an Amiga before, you will _not_ get very far without
    reading this getting started section. You will probably not even make it
    past the intro of your first game...

    So please read these tips very carefully!

    Seasoned Amiga veterans who know the Amiga inside out should also read
    this because half of the information is emulation-related.


Starting a game

: Start the bundled portable Amiga emulator (`winuae.exe`). This should bring
  up the configuration browser. If the **Games** folder is not expanded,
  double-click on it to open it. You can use the search box to narrow down the
  list of game configs. Double-click on a config and the game will start (note
  that floppy games might take a bit of time to load).

      Alternatively, select a game from the list by single clicking on it,
      click on the **Load** button below the configuration browser, then click
      **Start** to launch the game.

      If you want to play a different game, it's best to quit WinUAE with
      ++alt+f4++ then start it again.

Skipping code checks
: Some games have additional special configs to skip the intro or the
  manual-based copy protection check at startup (e.g., `Altered Destiny [skip
  code check]`). It's advised to start the normal config for the first time,
  just to experience the original game at least once.


Use warp mode
: You can speed up floppy loading times by using "warp mode". This speeds up
  the emulation as much as your computer can handle it. Pressing ++end+pause++
  toggles warp mode; .

Read the manual

: It's important to understand that control schemes and user interfaces were a
  lot less standardised in the 1980s and early '90s. You won't get very far in
  most games without reading the manual or the reference card first. Look for
  these in the `Manuals` and `Extras` sub-folders within the individual game
  folders.

Joystick-based games

: Most games in the collection are controlled with the mouse and the keyboard,
  but a few need a joystick. These games are configured for an emulated
  joystick: use the regular cursor keys (not the numeric keypad) for movement, and the
  ++ralt++, ++rshift++, or ++rctrl++ key for the fire button. If you want to
  use a real joystick or a gamepad, press the fire button on the controller
  after starting the game and WinUAE will auto-detect it.

Floppy games
: Hard drive installed games are the easiest to deal with, floppy games need a
  bit of practice. Read the [Floppy games](#floppy-games) section for details.
  You can easily recognise a floppy game by the emulated floppy drive sounds.

Saving your progress
: When it comes to saving your game progress, it's a bit of a Wild West
  situation. Every game is slightly different, and floppy games that require
  dedicated save disks are the trickiest. But fear not, help is provided for
  you on the [Game notes](game-notes.md) page for these titles. Make sure to
  read the detailed [Saving your progress](#saving-your-progress) section as
  well for general tips.

Read the game notes
: Always check the [Game notes](game-notes.md) page for special instructions
  when trying a game for the first time. Some of the advice there is very hard
  to figure out on your own, or the information is deeply buried in the
  manual.

Customising your setup
: If you're a power user, you should definitely configure the games for proper
  vertical syncing (vsync) for the best results. This is an advanced topic
  detailed in the [Graphics customisation](#graphics-customisation) section.
