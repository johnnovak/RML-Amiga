# Thanks

RML Amiga would not have been possible without the outstanding work of the
these presitgious folks:

- **Toni Wilen**, the man behind [WinUAE](https://www.winuae.net/) for making
  virtually perfect Amiga emulation freely available to all of us, and for
  implementing many of my improvement ideas and fixing bugs in a swift manner.

- The original UAE/WinUAE developers **Bernd Schmidt**, **Brian King**, **Bernd
  Meyer**, and **Mathias Ortmann** for starting it all.

- The entire [Software Preservation Society (SPS)](http://www.softpres.org/])
  team for their world-class Amiga game preservation efforts and the
  [KyroFlux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KryoFlux).

- The **hundreds of unnamed Amiga preservationist** who helped create the
  [official SPS Amiga game collection](http://www.softpres.org/games) RML Amiga makes
    heavy use of.

- **guest.r** for his excellent [CRT shaders for WinUAE](https://github.com/guestrr/WinUAE-Shaders).
  Not many know that his [early WinUAE work](https://eab.abime.net/showthread.php?t=61776) was the precursor for
  his the "CRT Guest Advanced" series highly popular in emulation circles today.

- **Crosire** for [ReShade](https://reshade.me/) RML Amiga uses for achieving
  authentic CRT emulation.

Special thanks to the following people who contributed to turning this into reality:

- **Kaucukovnik** (the creator of the [Amiga Dungeoneering Collection](https://rpgcodex.net/forums/threads/amiga-dungeoneering-collection.84467/))
  who was my major source of inspriration.

- **TheThirdFall** from the eXoDOS Discord for general morale-boosting and beta
  testing.

- My fellow oldschool Amiga enthusiasts from [RPG
  Codex](https://rpgcodex.net/) for inspiration.

- **Smiling Spectre** from the eXoDOS team for hunting down pristine manual
  scans for many games.

- The inhabitants of the **English Amiga Board** (far too numerous to mention
  individually) for tips and advice on how to get some of the trickier Amiga
  games running.
