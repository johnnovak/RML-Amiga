# CD32 and CDTV games

The **CDTV** (Commodore Dynamic Total Vision) and **Amiga CD32** were CD-based
game consoles based on the Amiga 500 and Amiga 1200 models, respectively. An
interesting trivia is that the Amiga CD32 was the world's first 32-bit
CD-based console (if we don't count the Japan-exclusive FM Towns Marty
released a few months earlier).

Most CDTV and CD32 games were meant to played with the bundled gamepad. It's
best to use a real game controller such as the Xbox 360 with these games as
they keyboard mappings can be rather awkward to use. A smaller number of games
support the mouse as well and are usually best played with it (typically
point-and-click adventure games).

The CDTV and Amiga CD32 were not very successful, but a few games have really
cool CD release exclusive content (e.g., CD Audio in-game music
in [Heimdall 2 (CD32)](TODO), voice acting and a tutorial section in [Battle
Chess (CDTV)), and there are handful of CD-exclusive titles as well (e.g.,
[Defender of the Crown II](TODO) and [Pirates! Gold](TODO)).


## Saving your progress

Most CD32 games support saving your game to the NVRAM, but they might only
support a limited number of save slots, or only allow you to save the game at
specific locations (e.g., [Frontier II: Elite (CD32)](TODO)). Then in some
game the save game implementation is rather buggy (e.g., [Heimdall II
(CD32)]()).
