## Gateway to the Savage Frontier

**WASD movement keys**

- Press ++home+w++ to switch to an alternative input mapping which maps the
  cursor keys to the WASD keys.

- Press ++home+q++ to switch back to the normal input mapping (e.g., in menus
  or when entering the name of your save game).


## Gold Rush!

- Supports two floppy drives, no disk swapping necessary.

- Floppy game that saves to the hard drive.

- When saving or restoring the game, enter **Save:** for the volume name, with
  the colon at the end (this is important). This will use the `Harddisk\Save`
  folder within the game folder for the save games.


## Guild of Thieves, The

- Right-click on the top of the screen and drag it down to see the
  illustrations.


## Hook

- Multi-language release (English, French, German).

- Supports four floppy drives, no disk swapping necessary.

- To access the save game menu, click on the **Use** icon then on the floppy
  disk in your inventory.


## Heimdall

## Heimdall 2: Into the Hall of Worlds (CD32)

- CD32 extras: CD Audio music, extra animations.

- This is the best version of the game that features all animations and a full
  CD Audio soundtrack.

- Needs a gamepad (it's very hard to play with keyboard mappings).

- You can only save in the Hall of Worlds by finding a special book.
  Unfortunately, this saving mechanism is buggy---it's possible to end up in a
  state where you're unable to revisit other worlds, preventing you from
  completing the game. Using save states is recommended instead (which isn't
  considered cheating because you can save anywhere in the OCS and AGA
  versions).


## Inherit the Earth (CD32)

- Unreleased official English version.

- The game is completable with some minor issues: movement is often sluggish,
  the "use" command sometimes misfires (e.g., it attempts to use the object on
  itself), and it may oocassionally crash. Make sure to save often.

- To skip the lengthy intro sequence, press the red and blue controller
  buttons.


## IK+

- Saves the high scores to the game disk.


## Ishar 1: Legend of the Fortress (AGA)

## Ishar 2: Messengers of Doom (AGA)

- Multi-language release (English, French, German).


## Ishar 3: The Seven Gates of Infinity (AGA)

- Multi-language release (English, French, German).

- The intro can't be skipped. Pressing ++esc++ during the intro will hang the
  game; use the "skip intro" save state instead.


## Jinxter

- Right-click on the top of the screen and drag it down to see the
  illustrations.
