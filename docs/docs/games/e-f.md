## Exile

- Galahad/FLT's 100% working crack, confirmed to be completable by himself.
  The official re-releases approved by the Amiga port's creator, Peter J. M.
  Irvin, are bad cracks done by The Company.

- The original game asks for security codes that were printed inside
  the sides of the game's box; we can't use the uncracked version until we
  find scans of those codes.


## Eye of the Beholder (OCS)

**WASD movement keys**

- Press ++home+w++ to switch to an alternative input mapping which maps the
  cursor keys to the WASD keys and turning left/right to Q/E.

- Press ++home+q++ to switch back to the normal input mapping (e.g., in menus
  or when entering the name of your save game).


**Save file compatibility**

- The save files of the OCS and AGA versions are compatible.


## Eye of the Beholder (AGA)

- Fan conversion that combines the 256-colours graphics of the DOS original
  with the superior sound of the Amiga version. It also adds the Amiga outro
  missing from the DOS version and an automap. The definitive version of the
  game; it's essentially bug-free.

!!! danger "Only use regular saves"

    The game is _not_ compatible with save states---only user regular in-game
    saves!

!!! warning "WHDLoad save game warning"

     This is a WHDLoad game which saves to memory. You *must* quit the game
     with the F10 key to write the save games to disk!

     If you don't do that and you just quit WinUAE, or load another game
     config, you will lose *all your save games* you made in the current
     gaming session!


**WASD movement keys**

- Press ++home+w++ to switch to an alternative input mapping which maps the
  cursor keys to the WASD keys and turning left/right to Q/E.

- Press ++home+q++ to switch back to the normal input mapping (e.g., in menus
  or when entering the name of your save game).


**Save file compatibility**

- The save files of the OCS and AGA versions are compatible.


## Eye of the Beholder II: The Legend of Darkmoon (OCS)

**WASD movement keys**

- Press ++home+w++ to switch to an alternative input mapping which maps the
  cursor keys to the WASD keys and turning left/right to Q/E.

- Press ++home+q++ to switch back to the normal input mapping (e.g., in menus
  or when entering the name of your save game).


**Save file compatibility**

- The save files of the OCS and AGA versions are compatible.


**Transferring your party from the first game**

- Copy the `EOBDATA.SAV` savegame file over into the game folder, then use the
  transfer option in the menu.


## Eye of the Beholder II: The Legend of Darkmoon (AGA)

- Fan conversion that combines the 256-colours graphics of the DOS original
  with the superior sound of the Amiga version. The definitive version of the
  game.

- If you get corrupted graphics (the colours appear wrong), just save your
  game, then reload it. You might need to restart the game before reloading.
  This will only occur a few times over the course of the game in certain
  later areas and it's not game breaking, only a minor inconvenience.

!!! danger "Only use regular saves"

    The game is _not_ compatible with save states---only user regular in-game
    saves!

!!! warning "WHDLoad save game warning"

     This is a WHDLoad game which saves to memory. You *must* quit the game
     with the F10 key to write the save games to disk!

     If you don't do that and you just quit WinUAE, or load another game
     config, you will lose *all your save games* you made in the current
     gaming session!

- Press ++home+q++ to switch back to the normal input mapping (e.g., in menus
  or when entering the name of your save game).


**Save file compatibility**

- The save files of the OCS and AGA versions are compatible with each other.


**Transferring your party from the first game**

You'll need to perform the transfer using the OCS version (this works because
the save files are compatible between the OCS and AGA versions). Once you're
done with the transfer, create a new save in the first slot. Copy the
resulting `EOBDATA0.SAV` over to the `vga-data` directory of the AGA version,
then load the save game from the first slot normally.

Note the `0` at the end of the file name; that's the EoB II save file and it
must be 46&thinsp;897 bytes long! `EOBDATA.SAV` (without the 0) is
33&thinsp;107 bytes; that's the EoB I save file you used for the transfer. If
you get an error when loading the save game in EoB II AGA, you must have
copied over `EOBDATA.SAV` by mistake.


## Faery Tale Adventure, The

- Patched and cracked version by Ross that fixes the garbled sound issue
  present on later than A1000 models and bypasses the manual-based protection
  check. Confirmed to be completable.

- Just press enter at the copy protection question after the intro.

- Save disk is in drive DF1: --- you must always have the save disk in DF1:
  to prevent game-breaking bugs.


## Fate: Gates of Dawn

- The official English version has censored nudity; the
  original image files have been manually restored from the German original
  (only the image files, so this is a safe change).

- Pay special attention to answer the manual-based copy protection questions
  correctly later in the game. Failing these checks too many times will cause
  the game to slowly deterioriate over the next few hours until it becomes
  unplayable and impossible to finish.


## Fish!

- Right-click on the top of the screen and drag it down to see the
  illustrations.


## Future Wars: Adventures in Time

- If you fail the protection check at the start, you will be asked to insert
  the game disk into drive DF0: --- just restart and try again if this happens.

- The game is configured to run from the hard drive, and the built-in save
  game mechanism only works when you run the game from floppies. So don't use
  the built-in save mechanism; use save states instead.
