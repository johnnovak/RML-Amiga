!!! warning

     This is a WHDLoad game which saves to memory. You *must* quit the game
     with the F10 key to write the save games to disk!

     If you don't do that and you just quit WinUAE, or load another game
     config, you will lose *all your save games* you made in the current
     gaming session!

!!! important

     Do *not* use saves states with this game! This is a WHDLoad game which is
     not compatible with save states (the game might crash or you might end up
     with corrupted save files).

**Save file compatibility**

- The save files of the OCS and AGA versions are compatible with each other.


**Transferring your party from the first game**

You need to perform the transfer using the OCS version (this works because the
save files are compatible between the OCS and AGA versions). Once you're done
with the transfer, create a new save in the first slot. Copy the resulting
`EOBDATA0.SAV` over to the `vga-data` directory of the AGA version, then load
the save game from the first slot normally.

Note the `0` at the end of the file name; that's the EoB II save file and
it must be 46897 bytes long! `EOBDATA.SAV` (without the 0) is 33107 bytes;
that's the EoB I save file you used for the transfer. If you get an error
when loading the save game in EoB II AGA, you must have copied over
`EOBDATA.SAV` by mistake.

## Faery Tale Adventure, The

- You _must_ always put the save disk in DF1: to prevent game-breaking bugs!


## Fate -- Gates of Dawn

- The official English version has censored nudity; the
  original image files have been manually restored from the German original
  (only the image files, so this is a safe change).



## Fish!

- Righ-click the top of the screen and drag down to see the illustrations.


## Future Wars: Adventures in Time

- If you fail the protection check at the start, you will be asked to insert
  the game disk into DF0: when running from the HDD. Just restart and try
  again if this happens.

- The built-in save game mechanism is broken when the game is run from the
  hard drive, so only use save states!
