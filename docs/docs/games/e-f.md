## Eye of the Beholder II:  The Legend of Darkmoon (OCS)

**Transferring your party from the first game**

Copy the `EOBDATA.SAV` savegame file over into the game folder, then use the
transfer option in the menu.


## Eye of the Beholder II: The Legend of Darkmoon (AGA)

**Transferring your party from the first game**

You need to perform the transfer using the ECS version (yes, you can load the
AGA save files into the ECS original). Once you're done with the transfer,
create a new save in the first slot. Copy the resulting `EOBDATA0.SAV` over to
the `vga-data` directory of the AGA version, then load the save game from the
first slot normally.

Note the `0` at the end of the file name; that's the EoB II save file and
it must be 46897 bytes long! `EOBDATA.SAV` (without the 0) is 33107 bytes;
that's the EoB I save file you used for the transfer. If you get an error
when loading the save game in EoB II AGA, you must have copied over
`EOBDATA.SAV` by mistake.


## Faery Tale Adventure, The

- You _must_ always put the save disk in the second floppy drive (DF1) to
  prevent game-breaking bugs!


## Fate -- Gates of Dawn

- The official English version has censored nudity; the
  original image files have been manually restored from the German original
  (only the image files, so this is a safe change).



## Fish!

- Righ-click the top of the screen and drag down to see the illustrations.


## Future Wars: Adventures in Time

- If you fail the protection check at the start, you will be asked to insert
  the game disk into DF0: when running from the HDD. Just restart and try
  again if this happens.

- The built-in save game mechanism is broken when the game is run from the
  hard drive, so only use save states!
