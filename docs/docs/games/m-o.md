## Moonstone: A Hard Days Knight

- Best played with a digital joystick.

- Hold ++esc++ key while the credits are loading to skip the intro.

  quite buggy. Certain actions or game events will inevitably result in
  crashes. The solution is to evade these actions. Use save states a lot, and
  in time you'll develop a feel for it what triggers the crashes.
