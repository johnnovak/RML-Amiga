## Gateway to the Savage Frontier

**WASD movement keys**

- Press ++home+w++ to switch to an alternative input mapping which maps the
  cursor keys to the WASD keys.

- Press ++home+q++ to switch back to the normal input mapping (e.g., in menus
  or when entering the name of your save game).


## Gold Rush!

- To start the game, double-click on the **GR Disk 1** icon, then on the
  **GR** icon.

- Save disk is in drive DF2:

- When saving or restoring the game, enter **Save:** for the volume name, with
  the colon at the end (this is important). Alternatively, you can enter
  **DF2:** as well.


## Guild of Thieves, The

- Right-click on the top of the screen and drag it down to see the
  illustrations.


## Heimdall

- Supports three floppy drives.


## Heimdall 2: Into the Hall of Worlds (CD32)

- This is the best version of the game that features all animations and a full
  CD Audio soundtrack.

- Needs a gamepad (it's very hard to play with keyboard mappings).

- In this CD32 version, you can only save in the Hall of Worlds by finding a
  special book. Unfortunately, this saving mechanism is buggy---it's possible
  to end up in a state where you're unable to revisit other worlds, preventing
  you from completing the game. Using save states is recommended instead
  (which isn't considered cheating because you can save anywhere in the OCS
  and AGA versions).
