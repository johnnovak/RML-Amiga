# Game notes

This section contains important tips and guidance for games that is a bit hard
to figure out on your own. It is _highly recommended_ to always check this
page before trying out a new game to avoid frustration.

The easiest way to find the notes for a game is to start typing its name (or a
part of its name) in the search box in the upper-right corner, then click on
the game's name in the search results.
