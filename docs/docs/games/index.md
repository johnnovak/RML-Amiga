**Starting a new game**

This game is quite special; you can only create your character as part of the
hard drive installation process. You must follow the below steps before you
can start playing the game.

  1. Start the **Amberstar [start new game]** configuration.

  2. Double-click on the **Amber_A disk** icon, then double-click on the
     **Install to HD** icon. Wait until the character loading screen appears
     (use warp mode; it takes a long time).

  3. Create your character, then press **OK**.

  4. Click on the right HD icon when the "Install where?" question appears.
     Enter `DH1:AMBERSTAR` for the path name.

  5. Turn on warp mode again and wait a few minutes until the "Installation
     complete" message appears. Press the left mouse button to exit the
     installer.

  6. Now you can start the game with the **Amberstar** configuration.


**Restarting the game with a new character**

Delete the `$RML_AMIGA\Amberstar\Harddisk\AMBERSTAR` folder and repeat the
above steps.

  manual (page 26).


## Eye of the Beholder II:  The Legend of Darkmoon (OCS)

**Transferring your party from the first game**

Copy the `EOBDATA.SAV` savegame file over into the game folder, then use the
transfer option in the menu.


## Eye of the Beholder II: The Legend of Darkmoon (AGA)

**Transferring your party from the first game**

You need to perform the transfer using the ECS version (yes, you can load the
AGA save files into the ECS original). Once you're done with the transfer,
create a new save in the first slot. Copy the resulting `EOBDATA0.SAV` over to
the `vga-data` directory of the AGA version, then load the save game from the
first slot normally.

Note the `0` at the end of the file name; that's the EoB II save file and
it must be 46897 bytes long! `EOBDATA.SAV` (without the 0) is 33107 bytes;
that's the EoB I save file you used for the transfer. If you get an error
when loading the save game in EoB II AGA, you must have copied over
`EOBDATA.SAV` by mistake.
