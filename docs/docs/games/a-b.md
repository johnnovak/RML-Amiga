# Aâ€“B

## Agony

- Supports two floppy drives.


## Altered Destiny

- Very long initial loading time. Use warp mode or the provided save state to
  get past that and the codewheel check as well.


## Ambermoon

- Official v1.07 English version (never published due to the demise of
  Thalion), plus Meynaf's v1.07 patch.

- The game is configured for a fast processor and plenty of memory, so you
  should be able to enable the display of the ground and the ceiling in 3D
  areas in the game's options menu.


## Amberstar

- v1.96 English release


**Starting a new game**

This game is quite special; you can only create your character as part of the
hard drive installation process. You must follow the below steps before you
can start playing the game.

  1. Start the **Amberstar [start new game]** configuration.

  2. Double-click on the **Amber_A disk** icon, then double-click on the
     **Install to HD** icon. Wait until the character loading screen appears
     (use warp mode; it takes a long time).

  3. Create your character, then press **OK**.

  4. Click on the right HD icon when the "Install where?" question appears.
     Enter `DH1:AMBERSTAR` for the path name.

  5. Turn on warp mode again and wait a few minutes until the "Installation
     complete" message appears. Press the left mouse button to exit the
     installer.

  6. Now you can start the game with the **Amberstar** configuration.


**Restarting the game with a new character**

Delete the `$RML_AMIGA\Amberstar\Harddisk\AMBERSTAR` folder and repeat the
above steps.



## Another World

- To skip the intro, press ++c++ and enter the `EDJI` continuation code.


## Bard's Tale, The: Tales of the Unknown

- You need to create a character disk before starting the game as described in
  the manual. The config already includes a new blank character disk in drive
  2 (DF1).
