- Has a single save slot only (forced "Ironman Mode"); saves the game to the

- Supports two floppy drives.

- When the game asks you to insert **disk 2**, just press ++end+3++ to insert
  the _third_ disk into drive DF0: (the first disk is the "boot disk"). This
  will eliminate any further disk swapping (except for saving to the boot
  disk on quit).
 
!!! danger "Tread carefully with save states"

    You cannot freely mix in-game saves and save states with this game!

    To be completely safe, only use the in-game save feature on quit. Or you
    can use only save states and never save in-game (but in this case try not
    to play the game for more than 15-20 hours in total).

    If you're careful, you can use short-term save states (aka save scumming)
    but _only_ during a single gaming session between two in-game saves to the
    boot disk.
