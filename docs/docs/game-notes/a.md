**Starting a new game**

This game is quite special; you can only create your character as part of the
hard drive installation process. You must follow the below steps before you
can start playing the game.

  4. Click on the right HD icon when the "Install where?" question appears.
     Enter `DH1:AMBERSTAR` for the path name.

  5. Enable warp mode again and wait a few minutes until the "Installation
     complete" message appears. Press the left mouse button to exit the
     installer.

  6. Now you can start the game with the regular **Amberstar** configuration.
