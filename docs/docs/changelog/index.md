## v1.0

Welcome to the first version of RML Amiga! This initial release features over
whopping 200 stone-cold Amiga classics.

Of course, all games come with manuals, code wheels, hint books, posters, box
cover scans, and all sorts of other supplementary materials to maximise your
enjoyment.

About 70% of the titles run from an emulated hard drive. The remaining 30%
are floppy games that require either no or only very minimal disk swapping.

Main highlights:


- All **Delphine**, **Horrorsoft/Adventure Soft**, **ICOM**, **Magnetic
  Scrolls**, **Lucasfilm/LucasArts**, **Revolution** adventures released on
  the Amiga.

- All **Interplay** Amiga releases (their early adventures, **The Bard's
  Tale** series, **Dragon Wars**, **Neuromancer**, etc.)

- Iconic strategy titles and action/strategy hybrids such as **SimCity**,
  **Lemmings**, **Pirates!**, **Populous**, **Powermonger**, **Cannon
  Fodder**, **Midwinter**, **The Settlers**, **The Perfect General**.

- 100% working uncracked originals of **Dungeon Master** (v2.2 and v3.60),
  **Chaos Strikes Back**, and **Fate: Gates of Dawn**, which are notorious for
  their elaborate copy protections (and lots of bad cracks floating around).

- The Amiga **SSI Gold Box** catalog in its entirety.

- The original versions of **Eye of the Beholder I & II** and their
  fan-made AGA remakes. These are the definitive editions as they combine
  the 256-colour VGA graphics of the PC versions with the superior sound of
  the Amiga ports (plus the first game includes the outro which was cut from
  the PC version due to disk space restrictions).

- Many other RPGs that are either Amiga-exclusives (**Perihelion**,
  **Amberstar**, **Black  Crypt**) or are best on the Amiga (**Legend
  of Faerghail**, **Ambermoon**, **Captive**, **Knightmare**, **Moonstone: A
  Hard Day's Knight**, **Starflight**, **Ishar series**, etc.)

- All AGI and SCI0 **Sierra** adventures (that's all their pre-VGA adventures
  with the parser), with optional Roland MT-32 sound in the few games that
  support it.

- 34 **Infocom** text adventures with all supplementary materials
  (that's every Infocom text adventure except for **Border Zone** which was
  never released on the Amiga).

- A good selection of **Cinemaware** classics (**Defender of the Crown**,
  **Lords of the Rising Sun**, and **It Came from the Desert I & II**).

- Arguably the best-looking version of **Elite** classic.

- All Freescape games by **Incentive** (**Driller**, **Dark Side**, **Total
  Eclipse**, **Castle Master I & II**).

- A handful of action game favourites (**Pinball Dreams**, **Agony**,
  **Shadow of the Beast**, **Speedball 2: Brutal Deluxe**, **IK+**, etc.)
