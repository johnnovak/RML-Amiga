That\u2019s fine, we\u2019re all a bit different. Rest assured, you can customise these settings to your liking, including turning off the CRT emulation altogether. But it\u2019s worthwhile to understand the reasoning behind the defaults first before you change anything.</p> <p>Out-of-the-box, RML Amiga emulates the output of a 15 kHz Commodore CRT monitor. Most people used their Amigas with such monitors in the 1980s and 90s (e.g., the iconic Commodore 1084S or the Philips CM8833-II])<sup>1</sup>. The default 3.0x scaling mimics the physical dimensions of such 14\u201d CRTs rather closely on 24 to 27\u201d widescreen desktop displays. Just grab a ruler and measure the diagonal of the image in an NTSC game; it will be about 13\u201d (33 cm) on a 24\u201d screen which is close to the diagonal of the viewable area on a typical 14\u201d CRT.</p> <p>So what, you might think. We have bigger and better monitors now, so why not make the best of them and let the image fill the screen completely? Well, because arguably that wouldn\u2019t be the \u201cbest\u201d thing to do.</p> <p>From a normal 1 to 1.5-meter viewing distance, the relatively small screen size of a 14\u201d monitor combined with the beneficial smoothing effects of CRTs produced an image that looked very smooth and strangely higher resolution than it really was. The CRT took off the edges of the \u201cpixels\u201d and added a subtle texture to the image (CRTs don\u2019t have \u201cpixels\u201d, but that\u2019s a longer story). The perceived quality of 320\u00d7200 Amiga games on Commodore monitors rivalled the experience of 640\u00d7480 games on much sharper PC CRT monitors. Sure, the Amiga\u2019s image was a bit blurrier and lacked fine detail, but it was nowhere near the extreme blockiness of how PC monitors presented 320\u00d7200 content! People moving on from the Amiga to the PC in the 1990s often complained about low-resolution pixel art suddenly looking overly blocky on their 14\u201315\u201d PC monitors.<sup>2</sup></p> <p>Let me stress this again: 320\u00d7200 content on the Amiga was smooth, not blocky as on the PC! On well-made art, the \u201cpixels\u201d literally melted away; you did not see jagged stairstep edges but smooth curves! </p> Legend of Faerghail (PAL, 3.0x scaling)(click on the image   to enlarge it) <p>That\u2019s all good and well, but some games still look subjectively better with the graphics slightly enlarged. For example, I like playing Pinball Dreams with 3.5x scaling so it almost completely fills the screen; it\u2019s just more immersive for me that way. So by all means, feel free to to adjust the image size depending on your display size, viewing distance, and personal preference. You might also want to use different scaling factors for different games. The Customising your setup section shows you how to do that.</p> <p>Be aware, however, that as you start deviating from the \u201ccanonical\u201d 14\u201d CRT image size (3.0x scaling factor), you will start seeing the \u201cpixels\u201d. The beneficial blur of the CRT emulation will also be enlarged, resulting in a subjectively less sharp-looking image. You can offset this by using the \u201csharp\u201d variants of the shaders; these will reduce the blurriness substantially, but at the expense of the beneficial smoothing effects\u2014the pixels will start looking blockier. Moreover, the scanlines will be more apparent at higher scaling factors, too, especially with the NTSC shader. You might want to force the PAL shader even in NTSC games to mitigate this as that renders more \u201cdensely packed\u201d scanlines.</p> Pinball Dreams (PAL, overscan, 3.5x scaling)(click on the image   to enlarge it) <p>As you can see, deviating from the canonical 14\u201d CRT image size is all about tradeoffs. Even on real CRT monitors, the experience is not the same on larger 17\u201d to 21\u201d displays. You just need to pick what\u2019s more important to you: authenticity and image quality, or image size and getting rid of the \u201cblack borders\u201d.</p> <p>This is certainly a fascinating topic; you can read more about it in my article that describes the CRT emulation setup of RML Amiga in detail.</p> <ol> <li> <p>The most popular Amiga model ever, the Amiga 500, had built-in RGB output but no aerial RF or composite connectivity to hook it up to a TV. There was a composite-compatible monochrome connector labelled Mono at the back of the machine, but doesn\u2019t count; nobody wanted to use their Amigas with a black and white TV. So people were faced with a simple choice: either buy the Commodore 1084S or similar RGB monitor with built-in speakers (this cost about 60-70% of the price of the Amiga 500), or purchase the RF adapter add-on which let you use your machine with a TV. The problem was the RF adapter still cost a non-negligible amount of money (about 25% of the price of the monitor) and had terrible image quality. Parents were not exactly thrilled with the prospect of their kids hogging the family TV all day, so most wanted to get their kids a dedicated display. Put it that way, the choice between a proper RGB monitor or a much worse quality small TV and an RF adapter became a no-brainer as the cost was about the same. Another stopgap solution was to use a special RGB to SCART cable with a SCART-equipped small TV, but the results were not as good (the horizontal resolution on a TV is a lot lower, so you could not read 80-column text easily). Plus you could not control your kid\u2019s TV watching habits if they had their own in their room.\u00a0\u21a9</p> </li> <li> <p>This is due to the fundamental design differences between Commodore and IBM PC CRT monitors. Commodore monitors such as the 1084S were effectively small high-quality TV sets with RGB input. Commodore was after the home computer and enthusiast market (at least in the beginning), so they found a way to effectively repurpose cheap small TVs into RGB monitors at an affordable price! These small-TVs-turned-monitors had great image quality, much better than your usual small TV, but their resolution and sharpness didn\u2019t come anywhere near specialised IBM PC monitors. PC monitors were the kings of sharpness, optimised for staring at spreadsheets all day at work, but they lacked the qualities of \u201clesser\u201d CRTs that put pixel art in a more favourable light. Being squarely aimed at the business market, they were several times more expensive than 15 kHz home computer monitors in the 1980s.\u00a0\u21a9</p> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"manual/customising-your-setup.html","title":"Customising your setup","text":"<p>You can customise your RML Amiga game configurations in two ways:</p> <ul> <li> <p>By using the special Configuration tool.

The primary goal is to run unaltered originals on the   systems they were developed for, which is a stock or expanded Amiga 500 for   most titles. A small number of titles run on an emulated Amiga 1200, Amiga   CD32, or Commodore CDTV. Native hard drive installations Hard drive installations are preferred for games that natively support it.   That\u2019s most big American releases and many European RPG, adventure, and   strategy titles. Also, quite a few games that don\u2019t have official HD   installers can be persuaded to run from a hard drive with a little Amiga   knowledge. 70% of the games in the collection run from the hard drive. No more bad cracks An overarching theme of the collection is \u201cno hacks allowed!\u201d For games   designed to run from floppies, the original floppy images are preferred with   the disk-based protection intact. Cracks, hacks, WHDLoad, and other fan-made   content are generally avoided and are only used as a last resort. For the   rare cracked versions, every effort was taken to confirm the game is   completable. No more worrying about bad cracks in those 40+ hour RPGs! Optimal configurations Some games benefit from faster CPUs or extra memory (e.g., they might show   more varied graphics or have more music and sound effects in the presence of   extra RAM). Then some games assume very specific configurations and start   exhibiting strange bugs if their expectations are not met. Figuring this out   for each game is tricky as it requires in-depth Amiga knowledge or manual   and forum diving\u2014usually all of the above, and this can be tedious even   for Amiga gurus. The good news is you don\u2019t have to worry about any of that;   all games have been configured to give you the most they have to offer. Play floppy games like a boss Every floppy game comes pre-configured to use multiple floppy drives if the   game supports it. This means zero or vastly reduced disk swapping. Blank   save disks are also provided for each game as creating them is often tedious   and error-prone (some games use special save disk formats). Authentic CRT monitor emulation Pixel art drawn and intended to be viewed on 15 kHz Commodore CRT monitors   looks outright broken on modern flat screens with the pixels displayed as   razor-sharp little rectangles. A CRT shader setup is included that   authentically recreates the look of PAL and NTSC Commodore monitors people   typically used their Amigas with. All monitor resolutions from 1080p to 5K   and beyond are supported. PAL/NTSC &amp; aspect ratio correctness All games are correctly set up for PAL or NTSC, including getting the aspect   ratio right while prioritising developer intent. No more playing American   releases with squashed graphics and 20% slower music or gameplay! Moreover,   PAL games that assume \u201cNTSC stretch\u201d are correctly set up, too (these are   typically Atari ST ports and European multi-platform releases). Quality-of-life save states Some games subject you to a manual-based protection check at the start,   have an unskippable intro sequence, or might take a really long time to load   from floppies. For these games, the collection provides save states taken   right after the protection check or the intro as a quality-of-life   enhancement. One less excuse for using questionable cracks and hacks! All necessary information included Manuals, reference cards, interactive code wheels, maps, posters, box art,   audio recordings, hint books, and various other extras to enjoy the games   to the fullest are all included. Quite a few games are next to impossible to   play without these materials. Significant effort has been taken to track   down the best-looking scanned copies for each game. Preserving custom Workbench screens A handful of games feature beautifully designed icons and Workbench screens   with custom colour schemes (Workbench is the graphical user interface of   AmigaOS). These works of art are worth preserving, and to date, RML Amiga is   the only game collection that attempts to do so. Curated demoscene collection The Amiga was (and still is) famous for its vibrant demoscene in Europe.   Demos are non-interactive audiovisual pieces of art created by Amiga   enthusiasts (traditionally teenagers) that showcase their coding and   artistic prowess and push the limits of what the machine is capable of. Many   elite-level programmers and artists of today had been forged in the fires of   the early Amiga demoscene. The collection includes a modest selection of   demos, with the eventual goal of including all demos presented in the   prestigious editions64k Amiga demoscene book   series (and then some more!)"},{"location":"manual/introduction.html#hardware-requirements","title":"Hardware requirements","text":"<p>RML Amiga has been developed and tested on Windows 10 64-bit.

As the Computer History Museum put it, it was \u201ca radical multimedia machine from a group of thinkers, tinkerers, and visionaries which delivered affordable graphics, animation, music, and multitasking interaction the personal computer world hadn\u2019t even dreamt of.\u201d That\u2019s a pretty accurate summary; the Amiga was at least a good 10 years ahead of its time.</p> <p>IBM PCs from that era cost a small fortune, could only display 16 garish colours at best, and had rather primitive sound capabilities. The Amiga could display 64 colours out of its 4096-colour palette (or even hundreds of colours with clever programming tricks, or all 4096 colours at once in a special video mode), and had 4-channel digital sound\u2014all that at a fraction of what an IBM PC costed<sup>1</sup>. Although early models only had a 7.14 MHz CPU, all Amigas were also equipped with custom graphics and sound chips (co-processors) that worked in parallel with the CPU, freeing it up to do other tasks. This is similar to how modern GPUs operate.</p> <p>In contrast, IBM PCs running MS-DOS had to do everything on the CPU by brute force. VGA graphics adapters and Sound Blaster cards were rather \u201cdumb\u201d compared to the sophisticated custom chips of the Amiga capable of semi-autonomous operation, so they needed a lot of CPU horsepower to drive. You needed a pretty fast decked-out Pentium to even just approximate what the original Amiga 1000 from 1985 was capable of. Although the Gravis UltraSound and Sound Blaster AWE32 cards eventually far surpassed the audio capabilities of the Amiga, they came late to the party and thus were sadly not widely utilised in DOS games.</p>"},{"location":"manual/why-play-amiga-games.html#amiga-vs-dos-versions","title":"Amiga vs DOS versions","text":"<p>In practical terms, any game released before 1990 has the potential to be vastly better on the Amiga. We\u2019re talking about \u201cpotentials\u201d here because there were many lazy Amiga ports of technically inferior DOS and Atari ST games, done by developers who did not understand the platform and thus did not utilise it to the fullest (Sierra is the most well-known example). But even these low-effort ports usually have superior sound on the Amiga.</p> <p>In the early 1990s, when 386DX/40 or better machines equipped with VGA and Sound Blaster became the minimum standard in gaming circles, DOS games started catching up with the Amiga. Due to the relative unpopularity of the Amiga in the USA, North American game developers started dropping Amiga support from 1990 onwards. Many post-1990 North American Amiga releases are nothing to write home about; most of them are low-effort ports of the DOS originals.</p> <p>The situation in Europe, however, was the exact opposite. The Amiga was vastly more successful there than IBM PCs right until the mid-90s when Windows 95 eventually took over (the German and the UK markets accounted for about 60% of total worldwide Amiga sales). Most European developers either adopted an \u201cAmiga-first\u201d approach, or at the very least properly utilised the strengths of the platform in their multi-platform releases. The biggest differentiating factor is usually the sound: even games made in the late 1993-1995 period have really good music and sound effects on the Amiga via digital samples of real instruments, while the DOS port often only has synthetic-sounding AdLib/OPL music, no sound effects, or some generic MIDI conversion of the original Amiga music.</p> Uninvited (Amiga, 1987) Uninvited (DOS, CGA, 1988) It Came From the Desert (Amiga, 1989) It Came From the Desert (DOS, EGA, 1990)"},{"location":"manual/why-play-amiga-games.html#general-recommendations","title":"General recommendations","text":"<p>In short, for pre-1990 games, it\u2019s not even a contest\u2014the Amiga almost always wins on all fronts.

Then regardless of the year of release, the Amiga versions are often the best-sounding, or at least they offer something unique in the sound department compared to the OPL or MIDI audio of their DOS counterparts.
