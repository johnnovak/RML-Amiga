Eye of the Beholder II: The Legend of Darkmoon (AGA)	1991	RPG	Westwood	HD	NTSC	A1200	Fan conversion that combines the 256-colours graphics of the DOS original with the superior sound of the Amiga version. The definitive version of the game.  If you get corrupted graphics (the colours appear wrong), just save your game, then reload it. You might be required to restart the game before reloading. This can only occur a few times in certain later areas during a full walkthrough and it's not game breaking, only a minor inconvenience.  Transferring characters  To transfer characters from the first game, you need to perform the transfer using the ECS version (yes, you can load the AGA save files into the ECS original). Once you're done with the transfer, create a new save in the first slot. Copy the resulting EOBDATA0.SAV over to the vga-data directory of the AGA version, then load the savegame from the first slot normally.  Note the 0 at the end of the file name; that's the EoB II save file and it must be 46897 bytes long! EOBDATA.SAV (without the 0) is 33107 bytes; that's the EoB I save file you used for the transfer. If you get an error when loading the save game in EoB II AGA, you must have copied over EOBDATA.SAV by mistake.	Retroplay WHDLoad version	WHDLoad
